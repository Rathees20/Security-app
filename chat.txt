- Topics: Connected VisitHistory, SocietyControl, and AdminControl pages to backend services using new API helper.
- Code: Added src/utils/api.js; updated src/pages/VisitHistory.jsx, src/pages/SocietyControl.jsx, src/pages/AdminControl.jsx.
- Decisions: Store auth token in localStorage for authenticated calls; normalize API responses to tolerate field variations; surface loading/error states in UI.
- Next: Hook up sign-in flow to persist authToken and retest endpoints with valid credentials.

- Topics: Replace filter icons across Admin and Society pages.
- Code: Updated imports and UI buttons in src/pages/AdminControl.jsx and src/pages/SocietyControl.jsx to use src/assets/filter.png; no other files touched.
- Decisions: Standardize filter icon via shared asset; keep styling consistent with existing buttons.
- Next: Verify icon appearance in other pages if they add filter controls later.

- Topics: Investigated Vercel login failures; ensured frontend hits deployed backend.
- Code: Updated src/utils/api.js resolveBaseUrl to use localhost-only proxy and fall back to https://securityapp-backend.vercel.app/api elsewhere.
- Decisions: Treat localhost hosts as proxy targets; send production requests directly to backend URL.
- Next: Retest login on Vercel deployment to confirm fix works end-to-end.
